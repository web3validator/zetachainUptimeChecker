# Humans Uptime Checker bot

Web3 Validator team has developed the checker bot that can monitor your node uptime. We can implement it on various Cosmos SDK networks and will gladly add it to humans mainnet network as soons as it will alive!

To run the bot, you need to do three things:

1) Start Redis
2) Install the necessary libraries
3) Make changes to the configuration
4) Run it through the service

**Running Redis via Docker**
```
sudo docker pull redis
sudo docker run --name my-redis-container --restart=always -p 6379:6379 -d redis --requirepass <your_password>

```

**(You must have Python version 10 or higher).**

**Install the necessary libraries**
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Make changes to the configuration**
```
nano .env.exemple .env
nano .env
```
You should change everything according to your own parameters.

**Run it through the service**
```
nano /etc/systemd/system/humans_bot.service
```
```

## Functionality

It's just super convenient:

*Without installing any software (grafana, tenderduty, prometheus or etc.)

*That bot not only warns that the validator is already in jail but pings you when your validator starts skipping blocks to keep you out of jail

*Ð¡an tell you about the time left before being sent to jail.

*Clear and pleasant interface and validator status check. Also this bot can be customizable and it may add many other functions. We already implement it in many known cosmos-networks.

*Auto-reporting bug/errors mechanism
